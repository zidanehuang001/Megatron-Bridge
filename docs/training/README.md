## Training Workflow

A typical training workflow involves:

1. **Configure Training** - Set up `ConfigContainer` with model, data, and training parameters
2. **Prepare Data** - Configure dataset loading and preprocessing
3. **Set Optimization** - Configure optimizer, scheduler, and mixed precision
4. **Enable Monitoring** - Set up logging and profiling
5. **Configure Checkpointing** - Set up checkpoint saving and resuming
6. **Launch Training** - Start training with configured entry points
7. **Monitor Progress** - Track metrics via logging and profiling
8. **Resume if Needed** - Use checkpointing to resume from saved state
