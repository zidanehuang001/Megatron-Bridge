# CUDA Graphs

CUDA graphs capture a sequence of GPU operations once and replay them with
minimal host overhead, eliminating repeated kernel-launch and driver costs on
every training step. Megatron Bridge supports two capture implementations and
fine-grained scope selection to balance performance gain against memory cost.

This page is the stable overview for what CUDA graphs are, when to use them,
and which constraints are durable. For operational setup, code anchors, and
verification commands, see [skills/perf-techniques/cuda-graphs/SKILL.md](../skills/perf-techniques/cuda-graphs/SKILL.md).

## What It Is

CUDA graphs work by recording a sequence of GPU operations (kernels, memory
copies, etc.) into a graph during a capture phase, then replaying that graph
on subsequent steps. This eliminates per-step host-side overhead such as
kernel launch latency and driver API calls.

In Bridge, there are two capture implementations:

| `cuda_graph_impl` | Mechanism | Scope support |
|---|---|---|
| `"local"` | MCore `CudaGraphManager` / `FullCudaGraphWrapper` | `full_iteration` (whole fwd+bwd) |
| `"transformer_engine"` | TE `make_graphed_callables()` per layer | `attn`, `mlp`, `moe`, `moe_router`, `moe_preprocess`, `mamba` |
| `"none"` (default) | Disabled | — |

## When to Use It

CUDA graphs are most effective when:

- **Tensor shapes are static** across training steps (fixed sequence length,
  fixed micro-batch size). Variable-length sequences break graph replay
  assumptions.
- **Host overhead is significant** relative to GPU compute — smaller models
  or high step rates benefit most.
- **Memory budget allows it** — graph capture allocates static buffers,
  typically adding a few GB. Models with `PP > 1` can consume over 10 GB
  of additional memory.

### Local full-iteration graphs

Captures the entire forward-backward pass as one graph. Provides the highest
host-overhead reduction but requires disabling NaN checks and has the largest
memory footprint.

### Transformer Engine scoped graphs

Captures individual layer components (attention, MLP, MoE router, etc.)
through TE. More flexible, works with MoE models where only dense modules
can be graphed, and supports selective scope combinations.

## Configuration

```python
cfg.model.cuda_graph_impl = "transformer_engine"        # or "local"
cfg.model.cuda_graph_scope = ["attn", "moe_router"]     # scope list
cfg.model.cuda_graph_warmup_steps = 3                   # warmup before capture
cfg.rng.te_rng_tracker = True                           # required
```

### Key constraints

- `cfg.rng.te_rng_tracker` must be `True` when `cuda_graph_impl != "none"`.
- `full_iteration` scope requires `cuda_graph_impl = "local"` and
  `rerun_state_machine.check_for_nan_in_loss = False`.
- MoE models with token-dropless routing have limited graph support
  (dense modules only).
- `cuda_graph_impl = "none"` automatically clears `cuda_graph_scope`.

## MoE Considerations

MoE models often cannot graph the full expert dispatch path due to dynamic
token routing. Common practice:

- Graph `moe_router` and `moe_preprocess` (static portions).
- Add `attn` scope for the dense attention blocks.
- Leave expert dispatch in eager mode.

Do not combine `moe` scope with `moe_router` scope — they are mutually
exclusive.

## Memory Impact

CUDA graphs allocate static buffers that persist for the duration of training.
Expect a few GB of additional memory. With `PP > 1`, memory overhead can
exceed 10 GB due to pipeline-stage buffering. Plan activation memory
accordingly.
