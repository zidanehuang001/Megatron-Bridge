"""Processing functions for GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) dataset.

Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k

GSM8K contains 8.5K grade school math word problems. Each example has a
``question`` and an ``answer`` field where the answer contains chain-of-thought
reasoning followed by ``####`` and the final numerical answer.
