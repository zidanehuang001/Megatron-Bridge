Model adapters for FlowMatching Pipeline.

This module provides model-specific adapters that decouple the flow matching
logic from model-specific implementation details.

Available Adapters:
- ModelAdapter: Abstract base class for all adapters
- SimpleAdapter: For simple transformer models (e.g., Wan)

Usage:
    from automodel.flow_matching.adapters import SimpleAdapter

    # Or import the base class to create custom adapters
    from automodel.flow_matching.adapters import ModelAdapter
"""

from .base import FlowMatchingContext, ModelAdapter
from .simple import SimpleAdapter


__all__ = [
    "FlowMatchingContext",
    "ModelAdapter",
    "SimpleAdapter",
]
