    Lightweight pretrained wrapper for Diffusers WAN models.

    Provides access to WAN config and state through the common PreTrainedBase API
    so bridges can consume `.config` and `.state` uniformly.

    NOTE: Due to Wan uses HF's Diffusers library, which has different checkpoint directory structure to HF's Transformer library,
          we need a wrapper to load the model weights and config from the correct directory (e.g., ./transformer).
          The diffusers's structure includes all components in the diffusion pipeline (VAE, text encoders, etc.).
          The actual transformer weights are stored in the ./transformer directory. Hence, we adjust the input and output
          path directory accordingly. We also need to override the save_artifacts method to save relevant correct configs
          files to the corresponding directory.
