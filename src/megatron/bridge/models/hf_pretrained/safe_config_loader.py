    Thread-safe and process-safe configuration loading with retry logic.

    This function prevents race conditions when multiple threads/processes
    try to download and cache the same model configuration simultaneously.
    Uses file locking (if filelock is available) to coordinate access across
    processes.

    Args:
        path: HuggingFace model ID or path to model directory
        trust_remote_code: Whether to trust remote code when loading config
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
        base_delay: Base delay in seconds for exponential backoff (default: 1.0)
        **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to AutoConfig.from_pretrained

    Returns:
        PretrainedConfig: The loaded model configuration

    Raises:
        ValueError: If config loading fails after all retries

    Environment Variables:
        MEGATRON_CONFIG_LOCK_DIR: Override the directory where lock files are created.
            Default: ~/.cache/huggingface/
            Useful for multi-node setups where a shared lock directory is needed.

    Example:
        >>> config = safe_load_config_with_retry("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B")
        >>> print(config.model_type)

        >>> # With custom retry settings
        >>> config = safe_load_config_with_retry(
        ...     "gpt2",
        ...     max_retries=5,
        ...     base_delay=0.5,
        ...     trust_remote_code=True
        ... )

        >>> # Multi-node setup with shared lock directory
        >>> import os
        >>> os.environ["MEGATRON_CONFIG_LOCK_DIR"] = "/shared/locks"
        >>> config = safe_load_config_with_retry("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B")
